# 🧠 Server Project – Key-Value Store with TTL and List Support

## 🚀 Overview

A fast, minimal, and extensible key-value store written in C++ for UNIX-based systems. Built with low-level control in mind, it uses custom non-blocking sockets and an efficient hashtable for performance. The store supports multiple types, including ordered list types using red-black trees, and introduces TTL (Time-To-Live) support for expirable keys. There are no threads or external dependencies.

The architecture is designed for simplicity and speed, focusing on deep control of memory, sockets, and file I/O.

## ✨ Features

* 🔌 Low-level non-blocking socket server using `poll`, `bind`, and `setsockopt`
* 🧠 Custom non-blocking event loop, no threads or callbacks
* 🧮 Strong type system: `int64_t`, `double`, `std::string`, and their list counterparts
* 🌲 Ordered list types (`list<int>`, `list<double>`, `list<string>`) implemented using red-black trees for efficient `O(log n)` operations
* ⏳ TTL (Time-To-Live) support for scalar and list values
* 💾 Optional persistence with binary dump/load support
* 📝 Log file support (enabled by default)
* 🧪 Python script for load testing
* ⚙️ Built with CMake for easy build setup
* ✅ Clean codebase separation (client, server, shared logic)

---

## 📤 Client Communication Format

The client sends requests as a sequence of strings.

Format:

```
[n] [len1][str1] [len2][str2] ... [lenN][strN]
```

Where:

* `n` is the number of strings.
* Each string is prefixed with its length.

This format is simple to parse and avoids complex serialization logic.

---

## ⚙️ Default Configuration

The server is launched via **command-line arguments**.

Default values:

* **Port:** `3000`
* **Persistence:** `1` (enabled)
* **Log Enabled:** `1` (enabled)
* **Data file:** `data/storage.dat`
* **Log file:** `logs/operations.log`

## 🛠️ Build and Run

**Supported Platforms:** UNIX (Linux/macOS). Windows is not supported.

### 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HusseinSerag/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 🔧 Build with CMake

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 🖥️ Run Server

```bash
./server_exec               # Uses default configuration
# Or manually:
./server_exec <port> <persistence> <data_file> <log_file> <log_enabled>

# Example:
./server_exec --port=3000 --persistence=1 --data_file=data/storage.dat --log_file=logs/operations.log --log_enabled=1
```

### 💻 Run Client

```bash
./client
```

### 📊 Run Load Test

```bash
cd script
python3 main.py
```

## 📃 Error Handling

* Malformed or invalid operations result in connection termination.
* Division by zero and similar invalid operations raise exceptions.
* The log file records all operations and results (if logging is enabled).
* TTL keys are automatically purged after expiration.

---

## 🧪 Load Testing

The `script/main.py` simulates multiple clients performing rapid operations to benchmark the server. On a local test, the server handled **13,000 `SET` operations** per second.
